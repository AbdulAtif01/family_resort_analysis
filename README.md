### **Resort (2022) Analysis**

This project was accomplished using two Python programming languages & Microsoft PowerBI. 

The original data can be found in the **resorts.csv** **snow.csv** folder

Python was primarily used for the following;
- Loading the data.
- Getting to know the data.
    - *Renaming columns.*
    - *Data cleaning.*
- Memory management. 
- Feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis. 
- Drawing observations and conclusions from plots, tables, and other visualizations.

Please kindly check **ski_resort.ipynb** for the analysis using Python.

Using Python laid the foundation for Microsoft PowerBI visualizations which could be seen in the **Resorts_Analysis_Dashboard.pbix** folder. This was made using the dataset produced from the Python analysis found in the **Created_Data.csv** folder.

### **Conclusion**

- From the observations, I would recommend the following countries to families because of their child-friendly resorts;

- Austria
- France
- USA (some resorts are not child friendly)
- Switzerland
- Italy
